- **`static/`**: Contains the PNG, which shows the spending visualization diagram of the current user using the web application.  
- **`templates/`**: Contains HTML templates for the frontend (`index.html`, `login.html`, `signup.html`).  
- **`.env`**: Stores environment variables, such as encryption keys.  
- **`app.py`**: The main application file (we are going to find every function to make the application work), built using Flask.  
- **`proposal.md`**: Contains the initial project proposal, outlining goals and requirements.  
- **`SOLUTIONS.md`**: Documents the main challenges faced during development and how they were resolved.  
- **`README.md`**: The current file, providing an overview of the project.
- **`.venv/`**: A directory containing the virtual environment for the project. It stores all the Python libraries and dependencies needed for the project, ensuring the application runs in an isolated environment. All the used technologies are stored in this directory.
